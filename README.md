## About
This project provides a minimalistic representation of a back-office dashboard feature used to screen and flag high-risk customers for KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance. Employees of Sample Bank LLC are target users of the dashboard.

Customer data are entered in the app and compared to individuals who are on a mock version of Treasuryâ€™s OFAC Specially Designated Nationals List (the list has been populated with test data for this project). Inclusion on the SDN List generally prohibits U.S. banks from maintaining accounts for those listed and U.S. persons could face civil or criminal penalties for engaging in business dealing with them. Should an individual be deemed a compliance risk, the dashboard user will be made aware of the issue.


### Test Cases
* John Smith and Jane Doe have been targeted under the Specially Designated Nationals List. If a form submission matches either name, it will be flagged as high-risk.
* Any individual with citizenship with an OFAC-sanctioned country, even if they dual U.S. citizenship, with be flagged as high-risk.
* Alison Norris has a Social Security number of 123-45-6789. If an account is opened that contains her name tied to a different Social, or her Social tied to a different name, it will be flagged as high-risk.
* Anyone who is not found in the Sample Bank's database will be flagged as medium risk, at a minimum. They may be high-risk if they have a Social Security mismatch, are included in the Specially Designated Nationals List, or maintain citizenship with a sanctioned country.
* Matt Lastname has a Social Security Number of 111-11-1111. His accounts are good standing. He is a low-risk customer.
