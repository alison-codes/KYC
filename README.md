## About
This project provides a minimalistic representation of a back-office dashboard used to screen and flag high-risk bank customers for KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance.

Sample customer data are entered in the app and compared to a mock list of indviduals  who are on the OFAC SDN list or known to be criminals. Should an individual be deemed a compliance risk, the dashboard user will be made aware of the issue.


## Resources
